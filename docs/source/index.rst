K3D-jupyter - documentation
===========================



K3D-jupyter is a Jupyter notebook 3d visualization package.

The primary aim of K3D is to be an easy tool for 3d visualization. We
designed it with native interoperation with existing powerful
libraries such as VTK however, it is not strictly depending on
them. K3D plots are ipywidgets, thus it assures a perfect interaction
of a browser side widget with Python kernel by a proven and
standardized protocol.
